## Description of projects in this repo

# Deepfake_detection_CT_Scans
Implemented 2 Supervised Machine Learning models - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) from Tensorflow and Random Forest from Scikit-learn to detect deepfake manipulation in CT lung scans.
Instructions to run files in the folder

- Step 1: Clone the repo
- Step 2: Navigate to the project specific folder
- Step 3: Run the VG_2D_3D_Experimentation.ipynb and VG_Random_Forest with data from the Preprocessed_data. (The data is already loaded in a cell in the notebook)
- Note: The VG_EDA cannnot be run as the raw dataset is too big to be uploaded into the repo. The output from the most recent run is saved in the notebook
  
# EuroSAT_decision_tree
Trained a Random Forest Classifier model on the EuroSAT data (~30k images) to perform land cover image classification. 
- Note: The dataset is too large to upload into the repo and so cannot be run. The most recent output is saved in the notebook

# Neo4j_Facebook_data
Demonstrated the advantages of storing information in a Neo4j noSQL graph database over a traditional PostgreSQL database.
- Note: The code cannot be run without access to a neo4j license which was provided to us as a student. However, the most recent output is saved in the notebook

# Unsupervised_Learning_Project
Implemented Unsupervised learning method using K-means clustering to identify common color characteristics of well-performing digital ad images. 
Instructions to run files in the folder

- Step 1: Clone the repo
- Step 2: Navigate to the project specific folder
- Step 3: Run the Unsupervised_learning_RGB.ipynb file with the data from the RGB_colors.csv file. (The data is already loaded in a cell in the notebook)

# Waist-to-height-ratio and A1C levels 
Conducted a statistical study on the relationship between the waist-to-height ratio and A1C levels.
- Step 1: Clone the repo
- Step 2: Navigate to the project specific folder
- Step 3: Run the clean_data.R file to load the files in the raw_data folder
- Step 4: The cleaned csv should then be loaded into the Lab-2-analysis.Rmd file.
- Folder contains the final RMD file used to generate all the graphs
- Note: The file paths need to be adjusted to load the correct data. But the final report pdf generated is in the repo
